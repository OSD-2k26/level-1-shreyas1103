hello everyone
## 🧩 LEVEL 1
 
Every journey begins with a single word.

- Before you can move forward,
- you must create a greeting
- and seal it with the word that begins everything.

## 🔐 Rules of the Path
- You can greet in any language but the first word must be **hello**
- The seal must be placed when you commit
- The seal is a single word
- And that single word is synonym of start
- No other name will open the gate
